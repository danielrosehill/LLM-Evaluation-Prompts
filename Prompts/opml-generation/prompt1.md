# OPML Generation Prompt 

Please generate an OPML file of RSS feeds containing news about Israel, the Israel-Palestine conflict, or world news (in that order of preference with RSS feeds about Israel being the most preferred and those about world news generally the least preferred).

Provide this data according to the latest information that you have available.

Only include news organisations which are based in this region: Central Asia.

Do not include a source unless the RSS feed is specifically about one of these topics.

For example, do not include news organisations' general news feeds. 

Here is a general example:

This RSS feed is appropriate for inclusion because it's specifically about Middle East news:

https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/MiddleEast.xml

This RSS feed is not appropriate for inclusion because it's simply a feed of the publication's general front page feed:

https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml
