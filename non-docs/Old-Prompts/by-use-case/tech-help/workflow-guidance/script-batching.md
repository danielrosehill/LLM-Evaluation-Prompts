# Prompt

I'm managing a repository of notes in VS Code that I'm publishing using Hugo via Netlify. Before I deploy, there are a number of things I need to check for. For example, the filenames shouldn't contain spaces (if they do, I replace them with hyphens). I run a Python script that updates the index pages in the repo (it's a wiki style site). As I continue developing this site, I'm sure I'll come up with more. Can you suggest an efficient workflow for running a batch of scripts so that I don't need to manually run them one by one?
