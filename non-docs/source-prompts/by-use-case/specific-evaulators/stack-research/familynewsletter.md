# A simple stack research prompt for a personal use-case

I'd love to begin sending out an email newsletter to family members. Using Mailchimp for this purpose is very clunky. Google Groups is one option but I don't really like it. I don't need any opt in features. I can add the few family members myself. Can you think of something that's perhaps actually built for this purpose? 

Here are some more requirements:

1: Has to have a free tier or be affordable
2: Ideally, I'd like to use a tool that was actually built for this purpose (rather than a commercial newsletter tool)
