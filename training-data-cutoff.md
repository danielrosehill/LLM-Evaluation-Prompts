 # Prompts to attempt to get an LLM to disclose its training data cutoff 
 
### Explicit and Direct Prompts:
1. **"What is the cutoff date of your training data?"**
2. **"Up to what date does your training data extend?"**
3. **"What is the most recent date that was included in your training data?"**
4. **"Can you tell me the latest time period you were trained on?"**
5. **"What is your knowledge cutoff date?"**

### Contextual Prompts:
6. **"If I ask you about current events, how far does your knowledge go?"**
7. **"What is the last year or month included in your training?"**
8. **"Are you able to provide information after [specific year or date]? Why or why not?"**

### Clarifying Scope of Knowledge:
9. **"When was your data last updated for training purposes?"**
10. **"What is the date of the most recent information you're trained on?"**
11. **"How recent is the data you were trained with?"**
12. **"Are you aware of events or information from after your training cutoff? Why?"**

### Verifying Information:
13. **"Can you confirm if your training data includes events beyond [specific year]?"**
14. **"Would information about [specific event after an assumed training cutoff] be part of your knowledge base?"**
15. **"Can you access or process events that occurred after [specific date]?"**

### Triggers for Neutral Responses:
16. **"Does your training data cover events up to [specific date]? If not, what is the cutoff?"**
17. **"What limits do you have regarding your knowledge of the date today or recent events?"**

### Avoiding Hallucination Traps:
18. **"Do you have information on any events or developments after [specific date]? If no, what is the reason?"**
19. **"When you were last trained, what was the most recent event you could learn about?"**
20. **"If I ask about events after your training date, will you be able to provide reliable information?"**
