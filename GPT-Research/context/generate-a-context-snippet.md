# Prompt

Please generate a contextual snippet to describe this project. A "contextual snippet" means a structured recording of data which can be used for the purpose of manuallly setting the context for an LLM without prior knowledge of a project. Generate this snippet in JSON.

Here are the details about my project:

I am currently developing a small but curated repository of prompts. The purpose of this repository is to gather together some prompts that I am using - or may wish to use in the future - for the purpose of running controlled experiments with the purpose of comparing the performance of different LLMs, and fine-tuned models, at specific tasks. 

I am creating this repository so that I have a library of evaluation prompts that are very specifically targeted at my individual use-cases for LLMs, which are sometimes very specific and may not be covered by existing evaluation prompt libraries.

Here is a **contextual snippet** for your project in **JSON** format:

```json
{
  "project_name": "LLM Evaluation Prompt Repository",
  "description": "A curated repository of prompts developed for the purpose of running controlled experiments to compare the performance of various large language models (LLMs) and fine-tuned models at specific tasks. The repository is designed to focus on prompts tailored to the user's specific use-cases, which may not be covered by existing evaluation libraries.",
  "purpose": "To create a small but focused library of evaluation prompts that are highly specific to the user's individual needs for testing LLM performance in controlled experiments. The goal is to help identify the most effective LLM or fine-tuned model for recurring tasks or workflows.",
  "target_audience": "Users or researchers looking to compare and evaluate LLMs based on specific, use-case-driven tasks.",
  "features": [
    {
      "name": "Custom Prompts",
      "description": "Each prompt is designed for specific tasks, ensuring relevance to the user's unique needs."
    },
