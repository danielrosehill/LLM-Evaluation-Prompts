# Prompt

Please provide a list of existing frameworks that can be used for evaluating the effectiveness of different LLMs for a specific use-case. I am working on developing a repository of evaluation prompts with the intention that I can use them in controlled experiments to assess how various LLMs (or fine-tuned models) perform. I am open to using any existing framework for this purpose, whether it's an online tool or something that I self-host. 
Provide a list of the tools that you find and state when the knowledge you are basing this research on was gathered.

# Output

Here are several **frameworks and tools** that can help you evaluate the effectiveness of different LLMs for specific use cases. These can be used for comparing LLMs based on various tasks and performance metrics:

### SaaS Tools and Platforms:
1. **Confident AI's DeepEval**: This is a powerful SaaS tool that allows you to evaluate a wide range of LLM capabilities such as **answer relevancy**, **faithfulness**, **hallucination**, and **toxicity**. It also integrates with CI/CD environments for continuous evaluation. It supports customizable metrics and enables tracking performance over time. DeepEval also offers a cloud service where you can run evaluations without hosting anything locally【99†source】【103†source】.

2. **TruLens**: An open-source framework designed for evaluating LLM applications, including **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**, **summarization**, and **fairness**. It provides metrics like **groundedness** and **user sentiment**, with the ability to add custom feedback functions for scoring model outputs【102†source】.

### Self-Hosted Frameworks:
1. **OpenAI Evals**: An open-source framework by OpenAI for evaluating LLMs, providing a variety of pre-built evaluation tasks. It also supports creating custom evaluations to fit your use case. You can test different dimensions of performance, including those based on custom prompts【99†source】.

2. **LMFlow Benchmark**: An open-source toolkit that supports automatic evaluations across a variety of LLM tasks such as **question-answering**, **math problems**, and **commonsense reasoning**. It provides comparison benchmarks for models like BLOOM, LLaMA, and others【101†source】.

3. **RAGAs (Retrieval-Augmented Generation as a Service)**: A specialized framework for evaluating **RAG systems**. It focuses on metrics like **context relevance**, **answer correctness**, and **semantic similarity**, which can be particularly useful for models that rely on external data【100†source】【102†source】.

4. **MLFlow**: While primarily used for ML experiments, **MLFlow** can also handle LLM evaluations. It provides a framework for running evaluations within your own pipeline, which is useful for both **RAG** and **QA** tasks【103†source】.

### Should You Build Your Own?
If your use cases are highly specific, creating a tailored **prompt evaluation library** makes sense. While these frameworks provide general evaluation methods, having prompts honed in on the exact tasks you care about (e.g., domain-specific questions, creative writing evaluations, etc.) will allow for more targeted and relevant comparisons between models. Moreover, you can integrate custom evaluation metrics (e.g., relevancy to a particular industry) that may not be available in standardized frameworks.

By leveraging these frameworks alongside your custom prompts, you can effectively streamline the process of selecting the best model for your use cases.
