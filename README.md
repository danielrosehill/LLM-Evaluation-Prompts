# My LLM Evaluation Prompt Repository
  
## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to gather together a curated collection of prompts for conducting controlled experiments aimed at **comparing and evaluating the efficacy of different large language models (LLMs)**, including fine-tuned models, for specific use-cases. These prompts are designed to facilitate targeted testing and help determine which models are most effective in performing certain tasks.

## Structure

`Eval-Prompts` - Prompts I've earmarked for evaluation purposes.  
`Old-Prompts` - Real prompts that I've previously run for generations (in some cases edited for PII-removal). Many of these are not that useful and repetitive. But they're reflective of the type of casual prompting I commonly use so I use them as "pipeline" candidates for future evaluations.

## Use Cases
The prompts included in this repository reflect some of the **specific use-cases** I have identified in my work with LLMs. These use-cases are unique to my context and needs, so the prompts may not necessarily be applicable or useful outside of this context. However, I am open-sourcing them here in case they may prove helpful to others looking to run similar experiments or tests.

## Experiment Results
Please note that in order to keep the data separate, I **will not be including the actual results of the experiments** conducted with these prompts in this repository. This repository is focused solely on the prompts themselves, serving as a foundation for evaluation and comparison.

## How to Use
Feel free to clone or download this repository, and use the prompts for your own LLM evaluations. Each prompt is stored in markdown format, with additional metadata that may help you contextualize or adapt it for your own experiments.
