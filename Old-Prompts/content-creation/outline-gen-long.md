# Prompt

I've been working on some development projects recently.

As somebody who isn't a professional developer (I started my career in communications), I find some of the workflows that are standard practice in development quite interesting - perhaps they're more interesting to me as an 'outsider'.

One that has always really connected with me is the idea of working in staging and production workflows, which I was introduced to when I learned Git at my last job.

When I work on creative projects, whether it's a blog or editing a video, I tend to put myself under pressure to finish something on the same day (e.g. if I start a blog, I'll usually aim to get it done before I wrap up on the computer for the day).

For me, this is very much tied into the idea of creative flow. Creatives tend to place a lot of value on getting their best work done while they're in "the zone" as writer's block is a professional menace. Sometimes, this impairs my ability to manage time effectively: I'm convinced that if I dont' get this blog post finished right now it will never happen.

But more often than not, I think this is actually an impediment to creative flow and that this attitude isn't helping me. So I'd like to unlearn it and think about new ways to proceed.

My best work usually comes when I've had time to think an idea over, talk about it with friends, etc.

An idea for a blog post that I've had for a while is the idea that "staging" is not only a good practice in software development, it's also kind of a good life philosophy. It brings discipline to the idea that sometimes we need to park our ideas to preserve our energy for tomorrow. Because in the technical sense staging involves saving your work to a separate environment, it also helps me to overcome my existential neurotic fear of losing data. It's okay to step away - it's in staging. We can come back to it.

I've been thinking about how I could expand upon this way of thinking. Perhaps I can begin staging important emails (just not in the drafts folder, I hate the drafts folder!). Blogs and video scripts would almost certainly benefit. I just haven't quite gotten round to thinking about 'how' yet.

Could you help me to come up with a decent outline to flesh out this idea a little?
