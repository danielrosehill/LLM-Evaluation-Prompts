There are a number of fonts that I really like to use on different projects, but sometimes remembering how each one looks is difficult. Most are Google Fonts. Is there any way to create a personal catalog of sorts of my favorite fonts that I can quickly reference when trying to pick a font for a specific project?

Potential complication: I use Linux (OpenSUSE) so unless a tool supports this OS specifically, a cloud-based tool is preferred.
