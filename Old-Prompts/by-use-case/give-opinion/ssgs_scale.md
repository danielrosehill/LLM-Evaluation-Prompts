Deploying static sites becomes very slow when they begin to scale. 

I'm using Hugo and Netlify and a site with several thousand pages can take ten minutes to build. 

Does this mean that static sites are inherently unsuitable for large content projects or are there frameworks and pipelines optimised for larger sites?
