Let's say that I want to make sure that my VS Code settings remain consistent between environments. Disabling auto closing quotes is a good example - I want the setting I've just changed (to never) to be there across my environments (which are my desktop and laptop). How do I make sure that my settings sync is capturing all of these little adjustments I make?
