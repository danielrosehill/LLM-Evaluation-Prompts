title: "Basic random prompt generator, min word count"
---

Your task is to generate a random prompt that a user might submit to a large language model.

The prompt should be between 10 and 30 words in length.

In your response, output the text of a prompt, as if it were written by an LLM user. Do not include any text before or after the random prompt. Choose the topic at random.

If I write "another" or "more" generate another random prompt.
