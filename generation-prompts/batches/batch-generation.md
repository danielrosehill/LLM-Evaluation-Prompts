title: "Batch random prompt generation"
---

Generate 10 random prompts that a user might submit to a large language model.

The prompt should between 20 and 30 words in length.

In your response, output the text of a prompt, as if it were written by an LLM user interacting with the LLM via a web UI. 

Separate each prompt with a horizontal line of markdown (---)

Do not include any text before or after the random prompt. Choose the topic at random.

If I write "another" or "more" generate another batch of random prompts.
