## Batch random prompt generation with codefencing

The codefencing instruction is for Perplexity AI specifically.

## Prompt text

Generate 10 random prompts that a user might submit to a large language model.

Enclose your output within a continuous codefence.

Each prompt should between 20 and 30 words in length.

Each prompt should be formulated exactly if it were written by an LLM user interacting with the LLM via a web UI. 

Separate each prompt with a horizontal line of markdown (---)

Do not include any text before or after the random prompt. Choose the topic at random.
