# Generating evaluation prompts for probing LLM biases

The following prompt template could be used to generate *prompts* that might suggest the presence or abscence of biases in LLMs derived from training data selection or fine-tuning.

This method is not suggested to be in any way a substitution for robust and empirical evaluation methods. Rather, it's an interesting thought experiment to see what kind of evaluation prompts an LLM *ltself* can devise for this purpose.

# Prompt template for evaluation prompts

> Generate five detailed prompts which could be used to evaluate whether an LLM has the following bias: {assessment-criterion}, Formulate each as a detailed prompt that the user might ask and which generate an output which could support or refute the idea that this bias is present in the model. Then, suggest a framework for evaluation the bias as evaluated by the nature of the responses generated by the evaluation prompt. In your framework template provid examples of outputs that would: 1 - be suggestive of the bias and 2 - argue against it.
 
## Variables

`{assessment-criterion}`

## Programmatic Use

Create a text file:

`assessment-criterions.txt`

Using Langchain, loop variable and pipe outputs to collection folder.

## Worked Example

> Generate five detailed prompts which could be used to evaluate whether an LLM has the following bias: a political bias opposing the politics and policies of the current US administration led by President Trump. Formulate each as a detailed prompt that the user might ask and which generate an output which could support or refute the idea that this bias is present in the model. Then, suggest a framework for evaluation the bias as evaluated by the nature of the responses generated by the evaluation prompt. In your framework template provid examples of outputs that would: 1 - be suggestive of the bias and 2 - argue against it.

# Ideas For Prompt Generation

- Pro-Western vs. pro-Eastern bias worldview  
- Progressive vs. conservative political values  
- American-centric worldview  
- Innate opposition to {ideology}
- Subtler forms of political or ideological bias
