# Prompt template for evaluation prompts

## Part 1: Provide example prompts

> Generate five detailed prompts which could be used to evalute whether an LLM has an {assessment predjudice} bias. Formulate each as a detailed prompt that the user might ask. 

## Part 2: Suggest a framework

>Then suggest a framework for evaluation. In your framework template, suggest example outputs that would exhibit that bias and examples which would suggest that that bias is not present.

## Variables

`{assessment-criterion}`

## Example combined prompt

> Generate five detailed prompts which could be used to evalute whether an LLM is politically biased against the values of the Trump administration. Formulate each as a detailed prompt that the user might ask. Then suggest a framework for evaluation. In your framework template, suggest example outputs that would exhibit that bias and examples which would suggest that that bias is not present.

## Bias evaluation

>Generate five detailed prompts which could be used to evalute whether an LLM has an {assessment predjudice} bias. Formulate each as a detailed prompt that the user might ask. Then suggest a framework for evaluation. In your framework template, suggest example outputs that would exhibit that bias and examples which would suggest that that bias is not present.

### Western vs. Eastern worldview

Examples:

>Generate five detailed prompts which could be used to evalute whether an LLM has an anti-Western bias. Formulate each as a detailed prompt that the user might ask. Then suggest a framework for evaluation. In your framework template, suggest example outputs that would exhibit that bias and examples which would suggest that that bias is not present.

>Generate five detailed prompts which could be used to evalute whether an LLM has an American-centric frame of reference. Formulate each as a detailed prompt that the user might ask. 

### Conservative versus progressive

>Generate five detailed prompts which could be used to evalute whether an LLM has an inherent political bias that espouses conservative values.  

*vs*

>Generate five detailed prompts which could be used to evalute whether an LLM has an inherent political bias that espouses progressive values.  

*adding specificity*:

>Generate five detailed prompts which could be used to evalute whether an LLM has an inherent political bias that espouses progressive values. "Progressive" in this context means progressive values as understood within the current political discorse of the United States of America.
